# Markdown file

Demonstration of various markdown syntax.

Seems much easier than HTML.

## To do list
- [X] Demonstrate headings
- [X] Create a check box list
- [X] Have a quote in the file. For example: 
> Do or do not! There is no try!  
> -**Yoda**
- [X] Create a code block. For example:
```java
public class Main {
  public static void main (String[] args) {
    System.out.println("This is a code block.");
  }
}
```
